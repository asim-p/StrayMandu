# Project Name: TBD (Hackathon — Stray Dog Solution for Nepal)

> Work in progress — short README for the hackathon prototype addressing stray dog welfare and human–animal safety in Nepal.

## Overview
A lightweight, pragmatic system to map stray dog populations, enable community reporting, coordinate rescue/vaccination, and provide data for local NGOs and municipal authorities. Built as a hackathon prototype — name and scope are provisional.

## Problem
Stray dogs in Nepal present public-health and safety challenges while also suffering from lack of coordinated care. Data is scarce and response is fragmented.

### Backend
✅ User register/login <br>
✅ Dog register <br>

## Goals
- Rapidly collect geolocated reports of stray dogs (sightings, injuries, litters).
- Provide a dashboard for NGOs/municipalities to triage and allocate resources.
- Enable volunteers to claim tasks (rescue, vaccination, feeding).
- Generate basic analytics to identify hotspots.

## Key Features (WIP)
- Mobile-friendly report form with photo upload and GPS coordinates
- Admin dashboard with map, filtered lists, and basic analytics
- Volunteer task assignment and status updates
- Exportable CSV reports for partners

## Suggested Tech Stack (prototype)
